# AfterEffect_Animation_Editor
This project aims to create a web-based application using React.js to edit Adobe After Effects animation files within a user interface (UI).

## Features:

      - Import After Effects Files: Users can import animation files in a compatible format (to be defined during development).
      - Animation Playback: The imported animation will play within the UI, allowing users to preview their edits.
      - UI-Based Editing: Users can edit animation properties through a user-friendly interface, including:
            Layer positions
            Layer colors
            Layer opacities
      - Interactive Editing: The application will implement editing functionalities based on user interactions, such as sliders for adjusting values or drag-and-drop for positioning layers.
      - Canvas Rendering: The edited animation will be rendered onto an HTML canvas element for real-time visualization.
      - Single-File Export: Users can export a single HTML/JS file containing all necessary code to render the final animation on a web page.
